# 👋 Hello there

I'm Marcio de Souza, a (feeling old) millenial currently doing the last year of my PhD in Theoretical Physics, where I study dark matter models for collider experiments. </br> 
I'm also a part-time data scientist with interest in language models and time-series analisys using different AI models. </br> </br> 




# 🚀 Expertise

I'm have a Licentiate Physics Degree from the Federal University of Uberlândia (2017). I worked as Mathematics and Physics teacher since 2015. Got a Master's degree in Physics from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in 2020 and I'm currently a PhD student with a scholarship in the same institution. I have some experience in Theoretical Particle Physics and Cosmology with a particular interest in theoretical modeling and experimental search for Dark Matter. I have been working as a data scientist since 2021, with experience in the area of time series analysis and AI data modeling. </br> </br>
